# pygent

* The architecture of the agent will be guided by the practical usecases defined

* Rough usecases:

	* Finance manager

	* Task assistant

	* Revision helper

	* IOT?

* In case of integration with software, it would be better if the core tool is already built and the agent merely 
interacts with it on a high level in order to minimize errors as much as possible

## Features

* Have access to tools such as browser (internet search), cmdline, calculator

* Have memory

## Tools

* Browser (search engine API)

* cmdline

* chart generator?

### Integration

* Standardized approach

* Need to give as much contextual information to the LLM (enforce doc strings)

### Nature: runner vs task executor
